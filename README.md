# Next Patch Prediction for Autoregressive Visual Generation, [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/)

In this work, we rethink the next token prediction for autoregressive image generation and propose a novel Next Patch Prediction (NPP) paradigm. Our method could reduce the training cost to
∼ 0.6× while improving image generation quality by up to 1.0 FID score on the
ImageNet benchmark. We highlight that our method retains the original autoregressive model architecture without introducing additional trainable parameters
or specifically designing a custom image tokenizer, thus ensuring flexibility and
seamless adaptation to various autoregressive models for visual generation.
